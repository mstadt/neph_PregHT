## Plotting Files

These files are for making the plots in the paper [Stadt et al. Effect of pregnancy and hypertension on kidney function in female rats: Modeling and functional implications, under review].

The folders contain simulation results from the model code for various simulation conditions.

The python scripts are named corresponding to the figure the script makes from the paper.
